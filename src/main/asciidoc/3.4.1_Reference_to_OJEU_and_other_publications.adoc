=== Reference to OJEU and other publications

For contracts above the threshold the procurer SHALL publish the contract documents, namely the Contract Notice, on the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU). The Qualification Application Request document MUST specify a minimum set of data ensuring the access to that information. 

Additionally to the reference to the OJEU, the Contracting Authority MAY also refer to other official publications where the documents were published.

The Figure below is a mock-up representation of how to collect the data expected to reference publications on official gazettes or journals footnote:[This mechanism can also be used for contracts below the threshold, obviously.].

.Information about the publication of the Contract Notice

The information required  is thus limited to these four data: the jurisdiction level of the journal, the name of the publication, the number assigned by the publication to the contract notice and the URL to access the contract notice (Notice that more than one publication can be added, button “Add publication”).

The UBL-2.2 common aggregate component used to hold these data is AdditionalReferenceDocument.

|*ESPD Use*|The ESPD-EDM uses this component to refer to official gazettes or journals as well as to external documents. Although the component allows both the reference (via a URL) and the embedding of  the content (e.g. as Base64 code), the ESPD-EDM always never embeds the content but uses the attachment URL field to refer to those documents.
