=== Criterion sub-elements

==== Legislation

Beware that:

*  the previous ESPD-EDM versions named this component LegislationReference. 
*  UBL-2.2 defines an additional element that is not currently used in the ESPD-EDM (JurisdictionRegionAddress) but that could be found useful by the MS.

The table below lists the minimum set of data used in the ESPD-EDM to inform about the legislation related to a Criterion. For details on the rest of unused UBL-2.2 elements see the spread-sheet /dist/mod/UBL-Entities-2.2-Pre-award.xls.xlsx.
