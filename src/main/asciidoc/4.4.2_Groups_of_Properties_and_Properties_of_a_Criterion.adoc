=== Groups of Properties and Properties of a Criterion

What really defines the Criterion are its “properties”, i.e. all the specific elements that the Contracting Authority defines inside a Criterion that will help determine whether the Criterion is fulfilled or not. The Criterion can thus be seen as a generic question that the Contracting Authority asks, and the properties are a set of concrete requests (optional or mandatory) and data (in the response) that, altogether, will be assessed to, namely, decide the exclusion or selection of the Economic Operator.

In the ESP these properties are always defined in groups of properties. A group of properties MAY contain (and usually contains) subgroups of properties that will need to be answered by the Economic Operator possibly depending on the answer given to the parent group (see subsections below for examples).

This way the ESPD-EDM predefines specific structures of data per each Exclusion and Selection Criterion. 

The table below shows all the elements of the UBL-2.2 component and lists the ones used in the ESPD-EDM.

|===
|*Element Name*|*cac:TenderingCriterionPropertyGroup*
|*ESPD Use*|A group of specific requests (optional or mandatory) that defines a specific data structure for a given Criterion. In the ESPD-EDM these data structures are predefined. See file /dist/cl/xls/CriteriaTaxonomy-V2.0.0.xlsx.

The next table describes the elements of one Property. Beware that it defines different types of possible data the Contracting Authority may request (and for which it expects an answer from the Economic Operator, e.g. ExpectedID, ExpectedValueNumeric, etc.). See examples of XML snippets below to further understand how this is implemented for the ESPD.

|===
|*Element Name*|*cac:TenderingCriterionProperty*
|*ESPD Use*|Concrete request for (or expression of) one datum specified by the Contracting Authority. +
The request for data is answered by the Economic Operator in the Qualification Application Response document.
