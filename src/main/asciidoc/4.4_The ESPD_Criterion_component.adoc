=== The ESPD Criterion component

This version 2.0.0 of the ESPD-EDM uses the UBL-2.2 component cac:TenderingCriterion to represent any Exclusion and Selection criteria. The global structure of the UBL-2.2 component is identical to the one in the previous version of the ESPD-EDM. Notice however that the naming of some elements have changed (e.g. “RequirementGroup” and “Requirement” are named as “TenderingCriterionPropertyGroup” and “TenderingCriterionProperty”).

See also section “5.6.3 Example 3: Weighting a selection Criterion” for an example of how to weight a Criterion.
