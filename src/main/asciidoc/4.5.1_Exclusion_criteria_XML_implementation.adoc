=== Exclusion criteria XML implementation

All the exclusion criteria in the ESPD-EDM follow the same rules for its implemention as XML:

.  Any element in the Criterion is compulsorily identified with a UUID generated by e-Certis;

.  Each exclusion criteria has a root EU Criterion and may have national or subnational sub-criteria. National and sub-national criteria are always nested under its parent EU exclusion Criterion;

.  For self-contained ESPDs, the Contracting Authority may add specific MS or procurement procedure requirements for a concrete exclusion criteria (see example for “Payment of Taxes” where the CA may specify a minimum threshold of unpaid taxes for certain countries where small debts with the MS Tax Agency do not exclude the Economic Operator).
