=== Example 4: Weighting a selection Criterion

The Contracting Authority may like to score the Economic Operators in the evaluation phase for which the CA would need to inform the EO in a transparent way on how it will be weighted.

|*SELF-CONTAINED ESPD FEATURE*|Weighting:

*	In an open procedure the CA has to consider all tenders that pass the selection criteria. The contract is awarded based on award criteria;
*	For two stage procedures for section C "Technical and professional ability" in selection criteria weighting should be possible. Section A/B/D in selection criteria are used as pass/fail;
*	The CA should have a free text where they can describe the scoring methodology;
*	The CA should have a field to specify the weight as a percentage or points;
*	The CA should have a field to specify the weight as a percentage or points;
*	The EO must have the possibility to answer the requirement in a free text.

==== CA view

The mock-up below represents the requirements the CA should be able to specify regarding the Weighting:

*	The general method used to score and evaluate the weighted criteria;
*	The evaluation method of the Criterion;
*	The weight allocated to the Criterion;
*	Complementary information regarding the evaluation of the Criterion.

In this case all the Criterion Properties informing about the scoring and weighting methods are placed into the subcomponents of the UBL-2.2 cac:TeneringCriterion element: 

*	cbc:WeightNumeric, to hold the weight allocated to the Criterion;
*	cbc:EvaluationMethodTypeCode, to hold the Criterion evaluation method; (compulsory use of the Code List “”; if no method is specificat it defaults to “Pass/Fail”;
*	cbc:WeightingConsiderationDescription, for additional information on the evaluation method;

==== Data Structure

In this case the data structure does not contain any requirement from the CA as all the data related to the weighting are placed in UBL-2.2 elements, out of the cac:TenderingCriterion component (the structure has not changed since the previous version of the ESPD-EDM).
