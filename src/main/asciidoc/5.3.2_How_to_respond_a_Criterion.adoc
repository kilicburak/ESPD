=== How to respond a Criterion

To answer each of the properties of a Criterion use the UBL-2.2 component cac:TenderingCriterionResponse component.

In the previous version of the ESDP-EDM the answers to each property where included in the element “ccv:Requirement”. In this new version, entirely based on UBL-2.2:

*	One Criterion Property from the Request document MAY be answered with a list of responses (not only one), provided all the responses are of the same type of data;
*	Each response MAY be supported by several evidences. The element cac:EvidenceSupplied is a pointer to the cac:Evidence component associated directly to the root QualificationApplicationResponse element (see section ”6.3.3 Evidences” below).

|*Child Name*|*Type*|*UBL Cardinality*|*ESPD Cardinality*|*Description*

|*cbc:ID*
|Identifier
|0..1
|0..1
|An identifier for this criterion requirement response.

|*cbc:ValidatedCriterionRequirementID*
|Identifier
|0..1
|1
|An identifier for this item of criterion support. ESPD rule: this ID MUST point at one Criterion Property ID that was included in the Request document.

|*cbc:ConfidentialityLevelCode*
|Code
|0..1
|0..1
|A code specifying the confidentiality level of the response to this criterion.

|*cac:ResponseValue*
|Complex
|0..n
|0..n
|The criterion property response values. ESPD rule: a collection of values is possible provided all the values are of the same expected data type. Beware of the cardinality 0..n: a cac:TenderingCriterionResponse may be used to refer to an cac:Evidence and do not provide any value.

|*cac:ApplicablePeriod*
|Complex
|0..n
|0..1
|The period to which this criterion property response applies.

|*cac:EvidenceSupplied*
|Complex
|0..n
|0..n
|A reference to the evidence supporting this criterion requirement response.
