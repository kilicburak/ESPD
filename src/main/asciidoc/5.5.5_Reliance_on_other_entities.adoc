=== Reliance on other entities

!===
|*SELF-CONTAINED ESPD FEATURE*|

If the Economic Operator relies on the capacities of other entites (e.g subcontractors) to meet the selection criteria, it MUST provide information about those entities.

The mock-up below represents the information that needs to be provided. Observe that the group of data requested per entity MUST be provided several times:

*	Name of the entity relied on;
*	Identifier and type of identifier of the entity;
*	Activity of the entity (for this specific procedure);
*	The lots in which the entity participates in.

The Criterion data structure is represented in the figure below, extracted from the Criteria Taxonomy spread-sheet. As in the previous case, beware that: 

.	The sub-group requesting the data about the entity may be repeated several times, as many as economic operators participate in the consortium;
.	Inside the previous sub-group, the sub-sub-group requesting the ID and ID type of the entity may be repeated several times.
