=== Answering the criteria and attaching evidences

This section provides fragments of XML code aimed at illustrating how the criteria expressed in the Request document (and also replicated in the Response document) MUST be answered. Beware that:

*	One answer is an instance of the UBL-2.2 element cac:TenderingCriterionResponse (see section “6.3.2 How to respond a Criterion ” for more details on this element).
*	Each answer responds to a concrete Criterion Property (UBL-2.2 element cac:TenderingCriterionProperty) by indicating the Identifier the Property has in the Request document (and which was originated by the e-Certis system at Criterion definition time);
*	One answer MAY be associated to one or more evidences. Use the UBL-2.2. element cac:EvidenceSupplied to refer to the evidences attached to the Response document. See also section “6.3.3 Evidences “ for more details on the component cac:Evidence
